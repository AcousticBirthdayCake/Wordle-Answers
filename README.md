# Wordle-Answers
The answers for Wordle for tomorrow, the day after tomorrow...

<p> This repository has the correct dates on all answers unlike some others where you have to skip a certain amount of days to get the correct answers.

<p> Some 'Day x' might be skipped due to the New York Times removing words 

<p> Example: 'Mar 17 2022 Day 27<b>3</b> MOVIE' and 'Mar 18 2022 Day 27<b>5</b> SAUTE'

<p> NOTE: There is no Jan-Jun 18 2021 Answers because Wordle didn't start yet
